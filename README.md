# RomanNumerals
(Based on textbox chapter 1 programming problem 1) Here is the repl link for this project: roman numerals. Here are algorithms for convertion: link. The class will internally store the number in string. You must design the class for roman numerals so that it follows this design:


romanType Class
You should also write private helper functions to convert from a int to a roman numeral, and from a string roman numeral to a int. (seen at bottom of class diagram)

Testing: Write a program that uses this class and all methods. You can assume that the input for Roman numeral is a legal string. Your test program should allow the user to enter/test more Roman numerals than the ones given in the text.
